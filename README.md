Predicting Tesla Stock Prices 


Project Objective and Implementation: Developed a hybrid time series forecasting model to predict Tesla's stock prices using ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM techniques. This approach integrated traditional statistical methods with advanced deep learning to capture both linear and non-linear patterns in the data, enhancing prediction accuracy and reliability.

Data Handling and Model Precision: Managed extensive stock price data from Yahoo Finance with complete records over a 10-year span. Achieved high model precision with ARIMA and SARIMA, demonstrating a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of approximately 0.036 on training datasets, indicating robust fitting to historical data.

Advanced Modeling Techniques: Employed LSTM neural networks, optimized with a 60-day lookback window for sequential learning, which effectively captured underlying trends and volatility. The LSTM model exhibited strong generalization, with an RMSE of 4.02 on testing datasets, closely aligning predictions with real stock movements.

Results and Impact: The models provided actionable insights for investment strategies by accurately forecasting stock price trends. This capability supports strategic decision-making in highly volatile financial markets, showcasing my ability to apply machine learning in complex scenarios.
